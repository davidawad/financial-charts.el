;; Part of L4.  A layout tree is (:group G) or (:concat "v"|"h"
;; :children NODES).  Each group G is a mutable plist holding its plot
;; size (:w :h), its chrome (space for axes, titles and legends) and,
;; once arranged, its plot origin (:x0 :y0).  Natural sizes follow the
;; theme's view config (continuousWidth/Height, step 20 per category);
;; concats space cells 20 apart with plot origins aligned.  With a
;; target size the plots are fitted so the whole chart fills it, which
;; is how charts follow Emacs window sizes.
;;
;; In svg, chrome is what Vega's autosize "pad" computes: the union of
;; the axes' bounds, the legends' boxes and the marks' overhang
;; (:mark-over, measured once items exist), each side rounded up.
;; Legends stack from the plot's top, 18px (legend.offset) right of the
;; plot and of any series marks overhanging it, 8px apart.
