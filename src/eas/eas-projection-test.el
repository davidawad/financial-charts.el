;;; eas-projection-test.el --- projections and shared layout fixes (fc-qx1.40) -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; fc-qx1.40, the scatter-table polish: map projections of
;; longitude/latitude points, positional scales shared across concat
;; views, secondary channels kept out of non-positional domains, layer
;; axis titles, ticks-off axis extents and config.concat.spacing.

;;; Code:
