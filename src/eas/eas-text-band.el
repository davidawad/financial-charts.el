;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L5, terminal half (fc-qx1.51).  A cell holds one glyph, but
;; the slices of a stacked area (or any areas that tile a column) can
;; meet inside it.  Drawn one slice at a time, the cell keeps whichever
;; glyph won, and an eighth block's empty top shows the terminal's
;; background: a hole in the stack.  The text renderer records every
;; slice's extent per cell and, once the mark is drawn,
;; `eas-text-band-resolve' composes the cells the slices tile: the
;; slice reaching the cell's floor as an eighth block, the slice above
;; it as the block's background.
