;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L4, for line, area and trail marks (eas-marks.el).  A series
;; is drawn through its rows in Vega-Lite's order: by the order
;; channel's field when there is one, else along x (along y when
;; mark.orient is "horizontal", Vega-Lite's dimension for that orient).  A row whose position is invalid (null) breaks the
;; path, as Vega-Lite 6's default mark.invalid does; "filter" connects
;; across it instead.  Curved interpolation is flattened into points
;; here so both renderers draw the same polyline: `eas-marks-path-monotone'
;; is d3's curveMonotoneX (monotone cubic Hermite through every vertex),
;; sampled by eas-curve.el.
