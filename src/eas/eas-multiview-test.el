;;; eas-multiview-test.el --- facets, repeat grids, flush concat, discretizing scales -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; fc-qx1.45: the multiview gallery group's features, each on a small
;; spec: every facet form lowered to a grid of cells with shared scales,
;; Vega's trellis layout (labels, field titles, spacing between plots),
;; wrapped repeats, bounds "flush", quantize/quantile/threshold scales,
;; shared top/bottom legends, and what check reports for header
;; properties the layout does not draw.
