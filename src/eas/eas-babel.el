;; Part of L7 (fc-qx1.13).  One org chart block type:
;;
;;   #+begin_src eas :template ohlc :data tbl
;;   {"title": "TSM"}
;;   #+end_src
;;
;; :template names a template; the body, when present, is a JSON
;; object of extra bindings (or, without :template, a whole chart/v1
;; spec).  :data binds the template's data slot from an org table, a
;; named table or babel result (through the org-table adapter), or a
;; .json/.csv/.tsv file.  Any other header named like a slot binds it
;; (:title "TSM", :points true), and :var NAME=REF binds slot NAME.
;;
;; What the block yields:
;;
;;   :file F :results file   F by extension: .svg native SVG, .json
;;                           resolved pure Vega-Lite, .txt the text
;;                           chart, .png/.pdf through bin/chart.
;;   :as view (default)      the text chart as the result, and a live
;;                           view inline (eas-babel-inline.el): the
;;                           SVG over it in GUI frames, the text itself
;;                           in terminals.  Clicking a mark jumps to its
;;                           source row (eas-babel-source.el).
;;   :as text                the text chart only.
;;   :as vl                  resolved pure Vega-Lite; with
;;                           :wrap src vega-lite it feeds ob-vega, and it
;;                           is what render's ::: {.chart} and bin/chart
;;                           take.
;;
;; While exporting no view opens, and :as defaults to
;; `eas-babel-export-as'.  :cols/:rows size the text chart and
;; :width/:height the SVG; both default to the spec's own size.
