;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L6.  A template (or spec) opts into live data with
;;
;;   "x-eas": {"stream": {"max-fps": 5, "window": 500}}
;;
;; Every `eas-push' to such a view is schema-checked at once (so a
;; bad row fails the caller, not a timer) and queued.  Queued rows reach
;; the view as one windowed push event, at most max-fps times a second,
;; and never while the user is interacting: a drag (brush or pan) is in
;; progress, or a pointer event arrived within `eas-stream-hover-hold'
;; seconds and no pointerleave followed.  When that ends the queue
;; catches up in a single frame.  The frame is an ordinary push event,
;; so the view log replays exactly what was drawn.
;;
;; The redraw itself stays idle-coalesced (eas-mode); the cap bounds
;; how often the scene is recompiled.  The default cap comes from the
;; measured cost of a push frame (docs/design/engine-spikes.md, section
;; 8).  Time is `eas-stream-clock' and timers can be turned off, so
;; ERT drives every case headlessly with `eas-stream-tick'.
