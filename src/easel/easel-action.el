;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L6 (fc-qx1.1, fc-qx1.5).  A click (mouse-1, RET at point,
;; or a click event an agent sends) that lands on a datum becomes a
;; click target, recorded in the view state as :click and shown by
;; `easel-inspect'.  The target then runs one named action from
;; `easel-actions'.  Which one, first match wins:
;;
;;   1. `easel-action-bind' on this view, keyed by mark id or param name
;;   2. the template's "x-easel": {"actions": {KEY: BINDING}}, same keys
;;   3. key "*" in either
;;   4. "open-href" when the datum has an encoding.href
;;
;; A BINDING is an action name, or {"action": NAME, ...} whose other
;; members reach the action as the target's :args (drill's template,
;; notes' directory).  A param key matches when the click sits in a
;; view whose point selection param of that name fires on click.
;;
;; A click on a legend entry toggles a bind: "legend" point selection
;; (the reducer's job) and becomes a legend target (:legend CHANNEL
;; :value V :param NAME :selected BOOL); it runs only an action bound
;; to that param's name or to "legend", never "*" or open-href.  GUI
;; frames reach legends through their :map areas, terminals through
;; RET on a legend cell: both are the same click event.
;;
;; Built-in actions: open-href (URLs in the browser, anything else as
;; an org link), echo (the tooltip in the echo area) and copy-row (the
;; row as JSON on the kill ring); easel-action-org.el adds goto-source
;; and open-notes, easel-action-drill.el adds drill.  Register more
;; with `easel-register-action'.  An action receives the target plist
;; and the view; what it returns (a string or number) is recorded as
;; :result, and a failure as :error (ENGINE_FAILED with :action), so a
;; click never breaks dispatch.  Binding an unknown action signals
;; NOT_FOUND with :action.
;; Set `easel-action-inhibit' to record the action without running it;
;; `easel-replay' never re-runs actions.
