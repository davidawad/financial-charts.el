;;; tooltips-click.el --- fc-qx1.1 demo: tooltips and click targets, headless -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Run from the repository root:
;;   emacs -Q --batch -L src/eas -l scripts/eas-demos/tooltips-click.el
;; It opens the ohlc and bars templates as text views, hovers and
;; clicks through `eas-dispatch' exactly as the buffer glue does, and
;; prints the chart, each hover tooltip and each click record.

;;; Code:

(require 'eas)

(defun eas-demo--centre (view mark i)
  "Pixel centre of item I of MARK in VIEW."
  (let ((item (aref (plist-get (eas-scene-mark (eas-view-scene view) mark) :items) i)))
    (vector (+ (plist-get item :x) (/ (plist-get item :w) 2.0)) (+ (plist-get item :y) (/ (plist-get item :h) 2.0)))))

(defun eas-demo--show (label value)
  "Print LABEL and VALUE as JSON."
  (princ (format "%s\n%s\n\n" label (eas-json-pretty value))))
