;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L4.  A bar (or rect) whose x or y is a timeUnit of a temporal
;; field on a time scale spans the whole unit in Vega-Lite: from the
;; unit's start to the next unit's start, inset half a pixel on each side
;; (binSpacing), and the scale's domain covers those ends.  The
;; channel's bandPosition (default 0.5) slides the span: 0 centres it on
;; the unit's start, as start + (b - 0.5) * (start - previous) to
;; end + (b - 0.5) * (end - start).
