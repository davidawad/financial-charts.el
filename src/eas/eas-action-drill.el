;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L6 (fc-qx1.5).  "drill" opens a detail view of the clicked
;; datum: finer-grained rows, drawn by another template or spec.
;; Binding arguments (x-eas.actions or `eas-action-bind'):
;;
;;   provider  a detail provider registered with `eas-register-drill',
;;             called with the target, the view and the args; it returns
;;             the detail rows (intraday bars for a clicked day, the
;;             transactions behind a monthly total).  Without one, the
;;             rows are the view's own source rows that share the
;;             datum's "match" fields (default: its x and color
;;             fields), i.e. the rows an aggregate was made of.
;;   template  the template drawing the detail, its rows bound to slot
;;             "slot" (default "data") plus "bindings"; or
;;   spec      an inline chart/v1 spec whose data the rows replace.
;;             Neither: the view's own resolved spec.
;;
;; The detail is a live view like any other, id PARENT>LABEL, sized
;; like its parent; it is shown with `eas-action-drill-show-function'
;; when the parent has a buffer.  The action answers the new view id,
;; so an agent drills by dispatching a click and then inspects it.
