;; fc-qx1.9.  `eas-bench-ladder' measures the engine at 1k, 10k and
;; 100k points on two fixed workloads, 800x400 (text 100x30):
;;
;;   line    a line with the Vega-Lite crosshair idiom (a rule layer
;;           filtered by a nearest pointermove point selection)
;;   points  a scatter of the same rows (the grid hit-test index)
;;
;; Stages, each (:mean MS :max MS :reps N):
;;
;;   compile-svg compile-text     whole scene, both targets
;;   render-svg render-text       scene -> SVG string / text grid
;;   hover-first                  the first pointermove (builds indexes)
;;   hover                        one pointermove: reduce, hit-test,
;;                                patch, inspect
;;   hover-svg hover-text         a pointermove plus the redraw the glue
;;                                does, before librsvg and redisplay
;;   hit-line hit-points          one eas-hit query
;;   lttb                         decimating N points to 800
;;   compile-points               the scatter scene
;;
;; GC follows the glue: "deferred" (default) runs at
;; `eas-gc-cons-threshold' as an interaction does; "default" keeps
;; this Emacs's own threshold.  Each stage starts after a collection.
;;
;; `eas-bench-check' compares a ladder with bench-budget.json: each
;; stage's mean may reach reference x tolerance x machine factor (or the
;; floor), where the factor is this machine's calibration time over the
;; reference machine's.  Targets (hover under 50 ms at 10k, fc-qx1.14's
;; hypothesis) are reported, not enforced.  Interpreted code is 4-10x
;; slower than byte-compiled, so the check only compares like with like.
