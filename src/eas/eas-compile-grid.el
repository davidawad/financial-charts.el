;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L4 layout.  A row-and-column repeat is laid out by Vega-Lite
;; as a grid (align "all"): every column is as wide as its widest cell
;; and every plot in a column starts at the same x, every row as tall
;; as its tallest cell.  `eas-repeat-expand' marks the vconcat of
;; hconcats it produces with x-eas.grid, `eas-vl-lower' a column
;; repeat's hconcat (one row); `eas-place-arrange-grid' places such a
;; node.
