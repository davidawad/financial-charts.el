;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L6.  A view is one chart someone (or something) is looking
;; at: {id, spec-hash, bindings, state, log}.  Ids are stable and
;; readable ("line:daily", "ohlc:TSM").  `eas-dispatch' applies an
;; event/v1 through the pure reducer, re-compiles only when the visible
;; output changes, appends to a bounded log and returns `eas-inspect'.
;; `eas-replay' re-applies a log.  None of this needs a display, so
;; ERT and agents drive every interaction headlessly.  Buffer glue
;; (eas-mode.el) only translates native events and redraws.
