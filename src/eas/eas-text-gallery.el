;;; Commentary:

;; fc-qx1.49: the gallery's verdicts (status.json) were measured on the
;; SVG backend.  This file is the text backend's gallery: every
;; official example except the topojson maps, and every template with
;; its example bindings, is opened as a live view the way a terminal
;; user opens it -- `eas-view-open' for the text target, then `eas-show'
;; in a text window -- at each of `eas-text-gallery-sizes', and judged
;; by `eas-text-check' (structural invariants computed from the scene).
;;
;;   `eas-text-gallery-entries'  what is checked: (:group :name :open FN)
;;   `eas-text-gallery-run'      one entry's problems, each "COLSxROWS: ..."
;;   `eas-text-gallery-report'   per-group counts and every problem
;;
;; test/vl-examples/text-status.json records the verdict per entry
;; ("pass", or "partial" with the problems as its reason); the :gallery
;; test holds each entry to it, so a pass cannot quietly regress and a
;; fixed partial must be promoted.
