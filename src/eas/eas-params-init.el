;;; Commentary:

;; Part of L6.  A Vega-Lite selection may start non-empty: "value" on a
;; point selection is an array of objects keyed by field or encoding
;; channel, on an interval selection an object of channel ranges.
;; Vega draws that initial state, so a static render and a freshly
;; opened view must too.  `eas-params-value-store' turns a param's
;; Vega-Lite value into the store of `eas-params'; date-time objects
;; ({"year": 2005, "month": 1, "date": 1}) become epoch ms.
;; `eas-params-initial-state' collects the stores of a scene's params.
